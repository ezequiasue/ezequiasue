### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ezequias S. Santos, a Ph.D. student in Web Sciences and Technology at UTAD - Lisbon Portugal, I have been working for over 10 years as a Systems Administrator in Brazil and in international projects.

However, I am organizing myself (studying intensely) since I am in Career Transition.

The market changes, and the careers concomitantly. In this sense, I applied myself to studying Python and Django Framework. Desire to develop new skills among other factors.
